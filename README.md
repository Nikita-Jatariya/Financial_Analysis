## Recommendations Based on Insights
- Focus on Top Performing Countries and Stores: Replicate successful strategies from these markets to underperforming regions.
- Address Revenue Decline After Q1: Investigate why revenue drops significantly post-QTR 1.
- Sales Representative Training: Provide targeted support or incentives for lower-performing reps to improve average revenue.

- Revenue Diversification: Too much dependency on top products and top stores can be risky, Introduce campaigns to promote lesser-selling products and underperforming stores.
